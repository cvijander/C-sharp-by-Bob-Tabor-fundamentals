// Variable declaration
int x, y, a, b;

// Assignent operator 
x = 3;
y = 2;
a = 1;
b = 0;

// There are many mathematical operators ... 

// Addition operator 
x = 3 + 4;

// Substraction  operator 
x = 4 - 3;

// Multiplication operator 
x = 10 * 5;

// Division operator 
x = 10 / 5;

// Orded of operation using parenthesis 

x = (x + y) * (a - b);

// There are many operators used to evaluate values ... 

// Equality operator 
if (x == y)
{

}

    // Greater than operator 
    if(x>y)
{

}

    // Less than operator 
    if(x<y)
{

}

// Greater or equal to operator 
if(x <=y )
{

}

// The are two "conditional" operators as well that can be used to expand / enhance an evaluation ...
// .. and they can be combined together mutliple times. 

// Conditional AND operator 
if((x>y) && (a>b))
{

}

// Conditional OR operator 
if((x>y)|| (a>b))
{

}

// Also, here's the inline conditional operator we learned about in previous lession

string message = (x == 1) ? "Car" : "Boat";

// Member access and Method invocation
Console.WriteLine("Hi");
